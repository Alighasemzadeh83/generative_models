# Generative Models

This repository contains implementations, experiments, and course projects from the **Generative Models** class taught by *Dr. Seyyedsalehi*.  
It covers both classical probabilistic approaches and modern deep learning techniques.

## Projects & Experiments

### Image Denoising
- Denoised images using neighbor-based methods.

### Bayesian Inference & Sampling
- Implemented **Gibbs sampling**, **rejection sampling**, and other probabilistic sampling techniques.

### Autoregressive & Sequence Models
- **PixelCNN** for image generation.
- **LSTM** & **GRU** (with and without Transformers) for modeling Persian text sequences.

### Variational & Adversarial Models
- **Beta-VAE** on the MNIST dataset.
- **Pix2Pix** on the Cityscapes dataset.

### Energy-Based Models
- Built **Energy-Based Models (EBM)** with Langevin dynamics on MNIST.

### Normalizing Flows
- Applied **normalizing flows** to the two-moon dataset.

### Diffusion Models
- Implemented **DDPM** and **DDIM** sampling for diffusion models on the Sprite dataset.

## Research Project

### Q-Score Matching (QSM)
- Studied and replicated experiments from the **Q-Score Matching (QSM)** paper.
- Used **JAX** and other ML libraries to implement QSM across multiple game environments, based on the paperâ€™s official code.
