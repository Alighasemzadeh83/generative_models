# Generative Models
This repository contains implementations and experiments from our study of generative models, including classical probabilistic approaches and modern deep learning techniques.

# Projects & Experiments
  ## Image Denoising :
    Denoising images using neighbor-based methods
  ## Bayesian Inference & Sampling : 
    Implemented Gibbs sampling, rejection sampling, and other probabilistic sampling techniques
  ## Autoregressive & Sequence Models
    PixelCNN for image generation
    LSTM & GRU (with and without Transformers) for modeling Persian text
  ## Variational & Adversarial Models
    Beta-VAE on MNIST
    Pix2Pix on Cityscapes dataset
  ## Energy-Based Models
    EBM (Energy-Based Model) with Langevin dynamics on MNIST
  ## Normalizing Flows
    Applied normalizing flows on the two-moon dataset
  ## Diffusion Models
    Implemented DDPM and DDIM sampling for diffusion models on the Sprite dataset

# Research Project
  ## Q-Score Matching
    Use the paper code on Q-Score Matching (QSM), using tools like JAX and other ML libraries.
    Implemented QSM for multiple game environments based on the paper's official code.
