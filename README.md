# Generative Models
This repository contains implementations and experiments from course work generative models taught by Dr. Seyyedsalehi, including classical probabilistic approaches and modern deep learning techniques.

# Projects & Experiments
   - Image Denoising :
    Denoising images using neighbor-based methods <br>
  - Bayesian Inference & Sampling : 
    Implemented Gibbs sampling, rejection sampling, and other probabilistic sampling techniques <br>
  - Autoregressive & Sequence Models :
    PixelCNN for image generation <br>
    LSTM & GRU (with and without Transformers) for modeling Persian text
  - Variational & Adversarial Models :
    Beta-VAE on MNIST <br>
    Pix2Pix on Cityscapes dataset <br>
  - Energy-Based Models :
    EBM (Energy-Based Model) with Langevin dynamics on MNIST <br>
  - Normalizing Flows :
    Applied normalizing flows on the two-moon dataset <br>
  - Diffusion Models :
    Implemented DDPM and DDIM sampling for diffusion models on the Sprite dataset <br>

# Research Project
  - Q-Score Matching
    Use the paper code on Q-Score Matching (QSM), using tools like JAX and other ML libraries.
    Implemented QSM for multiple game environments based on the paper's official code.
